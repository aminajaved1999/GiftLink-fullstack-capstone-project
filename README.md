# GiftLink - Full Stack Capstone Project

## Project Overview
GiftLink is a full-stack web application that connects users who want to give away household items they no longer need with users who are interested in recycling and finding free items. The application allows users to create accounts, browse available gifts, filter listings by categories, view detailed gift information, and post their own items. 

This application is built as part of the **IBM Full-Stack Developer Professional Certificate** Capstone project. The GiftLink project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and cloud deployment.
